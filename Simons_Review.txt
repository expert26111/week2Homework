Simon's Triangel Programme Review

The programme does work and covers the cases where:
-triangle side is negative
-string object
It is good that the programme does not stop but continues working
even if the user entered negative value or String object.
It is really good the programme checks if the triangle sides actually can 
be triangle sides.

It could be:
- used instead of type double for the triangle sides type float (less memory space)
- you could create only one Scanner object, put the creation of Scanner outside the method
